### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- My name is Pham Tan Dat, a 4th-year student at Nong Lam University. I am looking for a new environment to
raise software development capacity. I can work under high pressure and read technical documentation. One of
my strongest points is adaptability, I am ready to learn new things in such a short period of time
